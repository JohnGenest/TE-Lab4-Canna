For your app that recommends cannabis strains based on user responses to 10 questions, we'll need to consider aspects like the user's desired experience, tolerance level, consumption method, and any potential medical or recreational goals. I'll break this down into 10 effective questions, and then create an algorithm to match user responses with appropriate strains.

Algorithm to Recommend Cannabis Strains:
Let’s consider that we have 5 popular strains to recommend. Each strain will have attributes such as effects (e.g., relaxation, focus, creativity), THC/CBD content, flavor profiles, and ideal consumption time. Here are the top 5 strains we might use as an example:

Blue Dream (Hybrid - Sativa-dominant): Uplifting, good for focus/creativity, moderate THC, fruity flavors.
Girl Scout Cookies (GSC) (Hybrid - Indica-dominant): Relaxation, euphoria, high THC, sweet/earthy flavors.
Granddaddy Purple (Indica): Sleep aid, pain relief, high THC, strong sedative effects, fruity/earthy.
Sour Diesel (Sativa): Energizing, uplifting, focus, high THC, citrus/pungent.
Harlequin (Hybrid - High CBD): Medical relief (pain, anxiety), low THC, high CBD, earthy/herbal flavors.
Algorithm Steps:
Categorize the answers into effects, consumption preferences, THC/CBD levels, and time of consumption.

Assign weight to each question based on its importance to the recommendation process:

Reason for use (Q1) - High weight (30%)
Time of day (Q2) - Medium weight (10%)
Experience level (Q3) - Low weight (5%)
Desired intensity (Q4) - Medium weight (10%)
Method of consumption (Q5) - Medium weight (10%)
Strain type (Sativa/Indica/Hybrid) (Q6) - High weight (15%)
Flavor preferences (Q7) - Low weight (5%)
Specific condition (Q8) - Medium weight (10%)
THC preference (Q9) - Medium weight (5%)
CBD preference (Q10) - Medium weight (5%)
Score each strain based on the user’s answers. Here’s how we can assign points:

Reason for use (Q1): Match the strain’s primary effects to the user's choice (e.g., pain relief → Granddaddy Purple or GSC, creativity → Blue Dream).

Perfect match: +30 points
Partial match: +15 points
Time of day (Q2): Align strain effects with consumption time (e.g., relaxing strains for evening/night, energizing strains for morning/afternoon).

Perfect match: +10 points
Partial match: +5 points
Experience level (Q3): Strong strains (high THC) for more experienced users, mild strains or balanced THC/CBD for beginners.

Match: +5 points
Desired intensity (Q4): Match the user’s intensity preference with the strength of the strain’s effects.

Perfect match: +10 points
Partial match: +5 points
Consumption method (Q5): Recommend strains that are known to work well with the user’s preferred method (e.g., strains with terpene profiles suited for edibles).

Match: +10 points
Strain type preference (Q6): Match the user’s preference for Sativa, Indica, or Hybrid.

Match: +15 points
Partial match: +7 points
Flavor/aroma (Q7): Check if the strain’s flavor profile matches the user’s preference.

Match: +5 points
Specific condition (Q8): Recommend strains that are known to help with conditions like anxiety, pain, etc.

Perfect match: +10 points
Partial match: +5 points
THC preference (Q9): Match the user’s preference for THC strength.

Match: +5 points
CBD preference (Q10): Recommend strains with high CBD if specified.

Match: +5 points
Total the scores for each strain and recommend the strain with the highest score. For example:

Blue Dream might score high for someone seeking creativity and focus with a moderate intensity, fruity flavors, and daytime consumption.
Granddaddy Purple could score high for someone who needs pain relief, strong effects, and nighttime relaxation.
Example Scoring Calculation:
Let’s say the user answered:

Reason for use: Pain relief → Granddaddy Purple and GSC get +30 points
Time of day: Night → Granddaddy Purple +10 points, GSC +5 points
Experience level: Regular user → All strong strains +5 points
Intensity: Strong → Granddaddy Purple +10 points
Consumption method: Edibles → GSC +10 points
Strain type: Indica → Granddaddy Purple +15 points
Flavor: Fruity → Granddaddy Purple +5 points
Condition: Chronic pain → Granddaddy Purple +10 points
THC preference: Very important → Granddaddy Purple and GSC +5 points
CBD preference: No → No points for Harlequin
For this user, Granddaddy Purple would likely have the highest score and be the top recommendation.

This structure allows for fine-tuning based on specific user preferences while keeping the system flexible.
